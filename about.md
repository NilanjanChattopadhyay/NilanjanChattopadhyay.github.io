I am a deep learning enthusiast and mathematics nerd who is extremely passionate about machine learning.

I have been a part of **UnitedHealth Group's** Advanced Research and Analytics team since 2015. As a Data Scientist, I have worked upon several machine learning, optimization and deep learning projects. I also have a masters degree in Operations Research from **Hindu College, University of Delhi**. 

Through this blog I am hoping to reinforce my understanding of deep learning algorithms and to develop intuition of the mathematics behind it.
